# RNA-seq Analysis for Tbp1 in S. pombe

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for the analysis of RNA-seq data for the Cut14 protein in fission yeast. The analysis includes STAR alignment, RSEM quantification, and differential gene expression using edgeR.

## Scripts

1. edgeR_practice.R: Differential gene expression analysis using edgeR with custom dispersion value.

2. rsem.sh: Estimate gene and isoform expression from RNA-Seq data.

3. star.sh: Alignment of raw FASTQ files to S. pombe reference genome using STAR and samtools.
